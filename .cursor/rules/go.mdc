# Go Generate rules

- gqlgen generated code should not be modified directly. Instead, adjustments should be made to the [schema.graphqls](mdc:internal/graph/schema.graphqls) and then run `go generate ./...` to generate the code before making any changes. This will also update any existing models and method signatures.
- if [schema.graphqls](mdc:internal/graph/schema.graphqls) is modified then you MUST run `go generate ./...`
